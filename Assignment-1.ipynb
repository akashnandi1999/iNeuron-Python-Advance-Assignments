    "### 1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution :- OOP is a way of programming that provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, Abstraction etc. in the programming. The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data."

    "\n",
    "#### Solution :- An inheritance search looks for an attribute first in the instance object, then in the class the instance was created from, then in all higher superclasses. The search stops at the first place where the attribute is found."

    "\n",
    "#### Solution :- 'self' is the first argument in a class's method function special. When we define a class in Python, every method that we define, must accept that instance as its first argument (self). The 'self' variable points to the instance of the class that we are working with."

    "#### Solution :- The __init__ method is declared within a class and is used to initialize the attributes of an object as soon as the object is formed. Basically, to define a constructor we define __init__ method in python. While giving the definition for an __init__(self) method, a default parameter, named 'self' is always passed in its argument."
