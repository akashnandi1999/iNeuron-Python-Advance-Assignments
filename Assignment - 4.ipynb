    "#### Solution :- We can use the __getitem__() method to intercept slice operations (i.e., indexing with the square bracket notation that includes a colon to indicate a range of indices). When you use slice notation on an object, Python calls the __getitem__() method with a slice object as the argument."

    "\n",
    "#### a) When we want to provide a more natural syntax for performing operations on instances of our class. For example, we might want to define __add__() to allow two instances of our class to be added together using the + operator.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### c) When we want to provide compatibility with built-in Python functions or libraries that expect certain operators to be defined. For example, we might want to define __len__() to provide the length of our custom collection class, so that it can be used with the built-in len() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### d) When we want to make our code more readable and intuitive. By defining custom behavior for operators, we can make our code more expressive and easier to understand."
