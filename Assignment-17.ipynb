    "\n",
    "#### Solution :- Greedy syntax in regular expressions tries to match as much of the input string as possible, while non-greedy syntax matches as little as possible.\n",

To transform a greedy pattern into a non-greedy one, we can introduce the ? character immediately after the quantifier. For example, *? instead of *, +? instead of +, or ?? instead of ?."

    "\n",
    "#### Solution :- Greedy versus non-greedy matching makes a difference when there are multiple possible matches for a given pattern in a text. In such cases, a greedy match will try to match as much of the text as possible, while a non-greedy match will try to match as little as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For example, consider the text \"ababab\". The pattern \"ab.ab\" would match the entire text in a greedy manner, while \"ab.?ab\" would match only the first occurrence of \"ab\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### If we're looking for a non-greedy match but the only one available is greedy, then we can try to modify the pattern to make it non-greedy by adding the ? operator. However, there may be cases where it's not possible to get a non-greedy match using regular expressions alone. In such cases, we may need to use other techniques, such as splitting the text and processing it in multiple passes, to get the desired result."

    "### 6. In standard expressions, what is the difference between positive look-ahead and negative look-ahead ?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution :- In regular expressions, a positive lookahead and a negative lookahead are both types of lookahead assertions, which are used to check for a pattern without including it in the match.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A positive lookahead assertion is written as (?=pattern), where pattern is the pattern that is being searched for. The assertion will match if the current position in the string is followed by pattern. For example, the pattern foo(?=bar) will match the substring \"foo\" only if it is immediately followed by \"bar\". The \"bar\" part of the match will not be included in the match.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A negative lookahead assertion is written as (?!pattern). It will match if the current position in the string is not followed by pattern. For example, the pattern foo(?!bar) will match the substring \"foo\" only if it is not immediately followed by \"bar\". If \"foo\" is followed by any other substring or the end of the string, the match will succeed. Again, the \"bar\" part of the string will not be included in the match.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The main difference between positive and negative lookahead is that a positive lookahead requires the pattern to be present in the string after the current position, while a negative lookahead requires the pattern to not be present.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For example, consider the following string: \"abc123\". The pattern (?=\\d) will match the substring \"a\" because it is followed by a digit, while the pattern (?!\\d) will match the substring \"abc\" because it is not followed by a digit."

    "### 7. What is the benefit of referring to groups by name rather than by number in a standard expression ?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution :- Referring to groups by name instead of by number in a regular expression has several benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Readability: Group names can make a regular expression more readable and easier to understand. A descriptive name can provide more information about what the group is matching, which can be particularly helpful when dealing with complex expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Maintainability: Group names can make a regular expression easier to maintain. If the expression changes and the order or number of groups is modified, referring to them by name ensures that the code using the groups does not break.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Clarity: Group names can make the code using the regular expression more clear and self-documenting. Code that refers to groups by name is more expressive and makes it clear what each group represents.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Flexibility: Group names can be more flexible than referring to groups by number. If a regular expression changes and a group is added or removed, using group names ensures that code using the groups does not break."
